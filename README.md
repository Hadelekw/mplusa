# MPlusA
**MPlusA** is a Python library for calculations in tropical algebra (also known as (min, +) and (max, +) algebra). For the full list of the library's capabilities refer to the [documentation](http://maksymilian-wiekiera.fyi/mplusa/0_0_4.html).

# Contributing
The library is open for all contributions. If you want to contribute to its development, please refer to the guidelines to verify the code standards before making a pull request. Developments from all areas of tropical mathematics are welcome.

# Installation
The easiest way to install the library is to use pip.

``` pip install mplusa ```

The only automatically installed dependency is [NumPy](https://numpy.org). Otherwise the library does make use of [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for visualisations but it is not a required dependency and needs to be installed separately in case the user wants to use these capabilities.
